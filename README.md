BoneScan AI - Bone Fracture Detection System
About the Project
BoneScan AI is an intelligent web-based system designed to help healthcare professionals quickly and accurately detect bone fractures in X-ray images. Using advanced artificial intelligence, the system can analyze medical images within seconds and provide detailed results with visual annotations, making it easier for medical staff to identify potential fractures and make informed decisions.

The system combines cutting-edge machine learning technology with a user-friendly interface, allowing doctors and radiologists to simply upload X-ray images and receive immediate AI-assisted analysis with confidence scores and medical recommendations.
